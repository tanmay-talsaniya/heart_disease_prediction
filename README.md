# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Heart disease is a significant global health concern, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. In this project, our aim is to develop an accurate prediction model for heart disease using advanced data science and machine learning techniques.

# Project Overview
1)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

We began by conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset. This involved a thorough examination of the data's characteristics, distributions, and relationships between variables. EDA provided valuable insights into the dataset's structure and potential patterns, helping us make informed decisions in subsequent steps.

2)Data Preprocessing:

Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables were encoded using techniques like Leave-One-Out Encoder. This transformation converts categorical data into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.
Scaling Numerical Features: Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler. Scaling ensures that all features have the same scale, preventing certain features from dominating the learning process.

3)Model Evaluation:

We selected a variety of classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, and CatBoost.
These models were trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our primary focus was on recall, which is crucial in the context of heart disease prediction.

4)Hyperparameter Tuning:

We fine-tuned the models' hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. This technique systematically searches through various hyperparameter combinations to identify the optimal configuration.
Hyperparameter tuning improves the models' performance by finding the settings that lead to the best predictive outcomes.

5)Feature Selection:

Through correlation analysis and domain knowledge, we identified key features that have the most significant impact on heart disease prediction.
Feature selection enhances model performance by reducing noise and focusing on the most relevant attributes.

6)Model Evaluation and Interpretation:

The selected K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model demonstrated the highest performance in terms of accuracy and recall.
Recall, specifically, is critical as it minimizes the chances of false negatives, ensuring that individuals with heart disease are correctly identified.

# Results and Implications
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, combined with thorough feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, emerges as a robust solution for heart disease prediction. This model has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention, reducing the risk of overlooking critical cases.

# Conclusion
This project exemplifies the fusion of data science and healthcare, demonstrating how machine learning can contribute to medical decision-making. The developed heart disease prediction model, rooted in comprehensive exploratory analysis, meticulous data preprocessing, and rigorous evaluation, stands as a testament to the power of technology in improving patient care. While this project has educational and illustrative purposes, it underscores the potential of data-driven approaches in addressing real-world healthcare challenges.
